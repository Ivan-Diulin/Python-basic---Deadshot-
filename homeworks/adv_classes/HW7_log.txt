Implementation of abstract class Figure with abc method for changing coordinates.

Creating new figure from dict:
 {'FNAME': 'Horse 1', 'FCOORDINATE': (2, 2), 'FTEAM': 'black'}
Horse 1 (black) (2, 2)

Creating new figures in ordinary way:
Horse 2 (black) (1, 1)
Pawn 1 (white) (5, 5)

Moving figures by defining new coordinates:
Moved Horse to new coordinate: Horse 1 (black) (4, 5)
Moved Pawn to new coordinate: Pawn 1 (white) (7, 7)

Process finished with exit code 0
